# Diversity-and-Inclusion
I examined different demographic features like gender, age, and nationality, and used the information to compute important metrics for understanding the organization's diversity and inclusion initiatives.

I started the analysis by computing the diversity ratio, which involved comparing the count of women working in the company. Next,
I developed key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the male and female staff count, turnover rate, 
promotion rate in fiscal year 2020, promotion rates for both genders, and the ratio of new male and female hires within the given timeframe.

Additional key performance indicators were the turnover rate, the average performance rating of male workers, and the average performance rating of female workers. Utilizing these performance indicators, I created a dashboard presentation showcasing the company's diversity and inclusion efforts, highlighting both strengths and areas needing enhancement.

Key performance indicators that were computed
Number of Male, Female employees, 
* Percentage of Employees Promoted in FY20: This KPI measures the percentage of employees promoted in the organization during the financial year 2020.
* Percentage of Men Promoted: This KPI measures the percentage of male employees promoted in the organization during the financial year 2020.
* Percentage Turnover in FY20: This KPI measures the percentage of employees who left the organization during the specified period.
* Average Performance Rating of Men: This KPI measures the average performance rating of male employees in the organization.
* Average Performance Rating of Women: This KPI measures the average performance rating of female employees in the organization.

 # What is the definition of Turnover?

In business, turnover is the speed at which workers depart a company and are substituted with new hires. The calculation of turnover is typically done within a set timeframe, like a year, and can be presented as either a percentage or a ratio.

Various forms of turnover exist, including:

Voluntary Turnover - When an employee decides to depart from the company.

Involuntary Turnover - Occurs when an employee is fired or let go.

Functional Turnover occurs when an employee departs and is succeeded by a more suitable candidate for the position.

Organizations may worry about high turnover since it can result in higher expenses related to hiring, onboarding, and decreased efficiency.
A low turnover rate can be seen as a good indication for a company, suggesting that employees are happy with their work and are inclined to
remain with the organization for an extended duration.

# What is Percentage Turnover?

Employee turnover rate is the percentage of employees who have departed an organization within a specified time frame, compared to the total number of employees at the beginning of that period. This metric is represented as a percentage and offers a more concentrated perspective on the turnover of a certain employee cohort.

The typical calculation involves dividing the number of employees who departed the organization within a timeframe by the total number of employees at the start of that period, and then multiplying the outcome by 100.
Percentage Turnover = (Number of Employees who left during a period / Total Number of Employees at the beginning of that period) x 100%


# Insights & Recommendations

* 1. There is no women hires for executives position. (Hiring)
* 2. The majority of female workers hold junior roles, prompting a need for organizations to review their recruitment and hiring methods.
